# Natural Language Processing(NLP) Repository:<br>

- This repo contains various NLP notebooks, implementing the `Transformers Library` from HuggingFace:<br>

## Contents of the repo:
> ### Notebook-1: Natural Language Processing Introductions:
> - Notebook introduces how to use and initiate various transformer models for various NLP tasks like Sentiment Analysis, Question-Answering, Summarization etc.
> - It also uses the `pipeline` function, that acts as the highest level API of transformers library.
---
> ### Notebook-2: Breaking down the `pipeline` function:
> - Notebook showcases how the pipeline function works and what are the important components present inside it.
> - A pipeline wraps 3 components into itself
>>  - a. Tokenizer: component that breaks down input raw texts into input IDs,
>>  - b. Model: component that is the heart of the pipeline, this does the required tasks,
>>  - c. Post-Processing: component that converts the outputs generated by the model(LOGITS) into probablities/predictions, by applying a softmax function.
---
> ### Notebook-3: Instantiating a Transformer model:
> - The notebook showcases how instantiate a transformer model,
> - The notebook integrates "how to create and use a transformer model without relying on the pipeline function",
> - also shows how to use different configurations for each models, etc.
